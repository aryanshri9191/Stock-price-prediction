# Stock-price-prediction #
Machine Learning Project Using LSTM

This Stock Market Prediction Project aims to develop a predictive model that forecasts stock prices using historical data and various machine learning techniques. The project leverages time series analysis and machine learning algorithms to provide insights into stock price movements, helping investors make informed decisions.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow/Keras
Matplotlib/Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
Yahoo Finance API (or any other data source)
bash
Run
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-prediction.git
cd stock-market-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Run
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Run
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Collection: Run the data_collection.py script to fetch historical stock data.

bash
Run
Copy code
python data_collection.py
Data Preprocessing: Execute the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and prepare the data for modeling.

bash
Run
Copy code
python data_preprocessing.py
Model Training: Train the predictive model by running the model_training.py script.

bash
Run
Copy code
python model_training.py
Prediction: Use the predict.py script to make predictions on new data.

bash
Run
Copy code
python predict.py
Visualization: Generate visualizations of the results using the visualization.py script.

bash
Run
Copy code
python visualization.py
Data Sources
Yahoo Finance API
Alpha Vantage
Quandl
Kaggle Datasets
Modeling Techniques
The project explores various modeling techniques, including but not limited to:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Results
The results of the model will be evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values. Visualizations will be provided to compare predicted vs. actual stock prices.
